# aitravelhub
since there are secret API keys used in this app, this is just the code, but you can see the fully-functional app here: [aitravelhub.world](https://aitravelhub.world/). In order to best interact with the logic I have, it is recommended to type something along the lines of "I am looking for X thing (to do) in Y city." It should work so long as you include a "term" and a "location".

Note: I had said that I would try to store the data to a database, but the Yelp API prohibits this: [Yelp requirements](https://www.yelp.com/developers/v3/display_requirements)
